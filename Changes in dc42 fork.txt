Additional functionality in 0.78a-dc42 release compared to RRP 0.78:

* The Duet can serve all the files needed by the web interface

* All ADC readings are done in the tick ISR to avoid the processor having to wait for ADC conversions and provide faster thermistor and z-probe response.

* Additional over-temperature protection is done in the tick ISR, and the watchdog timer resets the system if the tick interrupt fails.

* A software watchdog is used to reset the processor if it gets stuck in a spin loop.

* Printing doesn't hang if the USB port is disconnected (or attached PC goes to sleep) during a print.

* The number of bits of temperature resolution is increased from 10 to 13 (i.e. 12-bit ADC + 1-bit oversampling) to increase the temperature resolution

* Thermistor parameters and ADC corrections can be set (M305 command).

* M208 command allow you to set axis minimum positions (e.g. negative x-axis position) as well as maximum positions.

* G1 commands with S1 parameter (i.e. seeking for endstops) do not need to be followed by a G92 command to work properly. The positions assumed to have been reached when endstops are hit are those set by the M208 command.

* Long filename support for files on the SD card

* The limit of 42 files in the list of gcode files on the SD card is removed (but there is still a limit of 2000 characters)

* M220 (set speed factor override) and M221 (set extrude factor override) commands are supported.

* Option to invert cooling fan PWM

* Additional z-probe type 3 is supported, for z-probe boards that incorporate more than one type of z-probe

* Separate G31 parameters can be saved for z-probe types 0, 1/2, and 3

* Various parameters (G31 values, IP address, MAC address, thermistor parameters, PID parameters) are saved to flash memory (note that these values do not survive a firmware upgrade)

* M122 diagnostics command shows additional parameters such as bed compensation heights, last reset reason, and up-time

* When pausing a print from SD card, if the printer is executing a 'wait' command such as M116, control is returned to the web interface immediately, without waiting for the command to complete (which could take a long time).

* The USB port is responsive immediately after power up or reset even when no Ethernet cable is connected

* A new file upload protocol supports much faster uploading of any type of file, without a limit on line length, and with a check that the file length is correct when the upload is complete.

* M80 and M81 ATX power on/off commands are supported

* M999 software reset command is supported

* FTP server supported (thanks zombiepantslol)

* Telnet server supported (thanks zombiepantslol)

* Bug fix: uploading file whose name includes an uppercase G now works. Similarly for setting a machine name containing an uppercase G (M550) or password containing an uppercase G (M551)

* Bug fix: if the machine name in an M550 command is followed by a tab character, then the name is assumed to terminate just before the tab character. Similarly for passwords set using M551.

* Bug fix: setting a machine name that contains a quote or backslash character no longer causes the webserver to return a bad JSON response in response to the rr_name request

* Bug fix: indentation of multipart messages sent to the USB interface now works properly


Additional functionality in web interface 0.95 compared to RRP 0.65:

* Faster (>6Mbytes/min), more reliable file uploading, with reporting and graceful recovery if an upload fails

* All web files and config files can also be uploaded

* More accurate (usually!) estimate of print completion time, based on filament consumption

* The machine name is displayed

* The filament requirement and object height are fetched automatically from the SD card file being printed, for use in estimating the completion time

* Works with FireFox as well as Chrome

* "Upload & Print" button (replaces direct web print button, uploads to the SD card first for more reliable printing)

* The extruder position box reports total filament extruded, instead of the amount extruded in the last move

* Additional status Halted is shown (if emergency stop has been used) as well as Ready and Active

* The Print Status tab includes slider controls to allow the speed and extrusion factor to be adjusted during printing
